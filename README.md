### Password Manager
This is a simple password manager written in python.
Other technologies:
    - tkinter
    - pandas
    - cryptography
Currently the password to log in into the program is masterpass.
If you want to change it you have to delete the security.csv and then 
start the program. It will ask for your new password in TERMINAL.
After you entered the new password, restart the program. This way a new 
security file is created, with a new masterpass and a new key for encryption and decryption.
CAUTION! If you change the security file you cant use previously saved passwords 
because the encryption key has been changed.
